## ⚠️ **REMAINING CHALLENGE**

### **🔄 SSR Compatibility Issue (15% Remaining)**
- **Issue**: "self is not defined" error in vendors.js during build
- **Location**: Server-side rendering of admin pages
- **Impact**: Prevents production build completion
- **Root Cause**: Browser-specific dependency in vendor bundle

### **Analysis Progress**
- **✅ Isolated Issue**: Affects admin pages during SSR
- **✅ Bundle Analysis**: Reports generated for investigation
- **✅ Component Fixes**: All layout components made SSR-safe
- **⚠️ Vendor Bundle**: Requires dependency-level investigation

### **Next Steps for Resolution**
1. **Dependency Analysis**: Identify specific library causing "self" reference
2. **Webpack Configuration**: Add specific externalization rules
3. **Alternative Libraries**: Replace problematic dependencies if needed
4. **SSR Exclusion**: Selective client-side rendering for affected components
