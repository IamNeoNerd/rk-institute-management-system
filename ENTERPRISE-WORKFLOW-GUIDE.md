# 🏢 Enterprise Development & CI/CD Workflow Guide

## 📋 **Overview**

This document outlines the complete enterprise-grade development workflow implemented for the RK Institute Management System. This workflow ensures code quality, security, and deployment reliability through automated processes and strict quality gates.

## 🌊 **GitFlow Branching Strategy**

### **Branch Structure**
```
main (production)
├── develop (integration)
├── feature/setup-cicd-workflow
├── feature/user-authentication
├── bugfix/login-validation
└── hotfix/security-patch
```

### **Branch Protection Rules**

#### **Main Branch Protection**
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
- ❌ Allow force pushes
- ❌ Allow deletions

#### **Develop Branch Protection**
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ❌ Allow force pushes
- ❌ Allow deletions

## 🔄 **Continuous Integration Pipeline**

### **Automated Quality Gates**

#### **1. Code Quality & Linting** 🎨
- ESLint code quality checks
- Prettier formatting validation
- TypeScript compilation verification
- **Failure = PR Blocked**

#### **2. Security Scanning** 🔒
- npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- Security vulnerability assessment
- High-severity issue detection
- **Critical Issues = PR Blocked**

#### **3. Test Execution** 🧪
- Jest unit test suite
- Integration test execution
- Code coverage reporting
- **Test Failures = PR Blocked**

#### **4. Build Verification** 🏗️
- Production build compilation
- Database migration validation
- Prisma client generation
- **Build Failures = PR Blocked**

### **CI Trigger Events**
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop`
- Pushes to `develop` branch
- Draft PRs are skipped

---

## 🚀 **Continuous Deployment Pipeline**

### **Deployment Environments**

#### **Production Deployment** 🌟
- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
- **URL**: https://rk-institute-management-system.vercel.app
- **Requirements**: All CI checks must pass
- **Process**: Automated deployment with health checks

#### **Staging Deployment** 🧪
- **Trigger**: Push to `develop` branch
- **URL**: https://rk-institute-management-system-staging.vercel.app
- **Purpose**: Integration testing and preview
- **Process**: Automated deployment with validation

### **Deployment Process**
1. **Pre-deployment Checks** - Environment determination
2. **Build & Deploy** - Vercel deployment execution
3. **Health Checks** - Application availability verification
4. **Notification** - Success/failure reporting

## 📝 **Development Workflow Process**

### **Step 1: Feature Development**
```bash
# Start from develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Develop your feature
# ... make changes ...

# Commit with conventional format
git commit -m "feat(scope): add new feature description"
```

### **Step 2: Pre-PR Quality Checks**
```bash
# Run all quality checks locally
npm run lint          # Code linting
npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation
npm test             # Test execution
npm run build        # Production build test
```

### **Step 3: Pull Request Creation**
1. Push feature branch to GitHub
2. Create PR using the template
3. Fill out all required sections
4. Complete the pre-merge checklist
5. Request reviews from team members

### **Step 4: Automated CI Process**
- CI pipeline runs automatically
- All quality gates must pass
- PR is blocked until all checks succeed
- Preview deployment created for testing

### **Step 5: Code Review & Approval**
- Minimum 2 reviewer approvals required
- Address all review feedback
- Ensure all discussions are resolved
- Verify preview deployment functionality

### **Step 6: Merge & Deployment**
- Use "Squash and Merge" for clean history
- Automatic deployment to staging (develop)
- Manual promotion to production (main)

## ✅ **Quality Assurance Checklist**

### **Before Creating PR**
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Code builds successfully
- [ ] Linting issues resolved
- [ ] TypeScript compilation clean
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated

### **Before Merging PR**
- [ ] All CI checks passing
- [ ] 2+ approvals received
- [ ] Preview deployment tested
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] All discussions resolved
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

---

## 🚨 **Emergency Procedures**

### **Hotfix Process**
```bash
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix

# Make minimal fix
# ... fix the issue ...

# Create PR directly to main
# Emergency merge with single approval
# Immediate production deployment
```

### **Rollback Process**
1. Identify problematic deployment
2. Revert commit on main branch
3. Automatic redeployment triggered
4. Verify rollback success
5. Create follow-up fix PR

---
