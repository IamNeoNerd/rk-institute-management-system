## ⚠️ **REMAINING CHALLENGE (10%)**

### **🔄 Vendor Bundle SSR Issue**
- **Issue**: "self is not defined" in vendors.js affecting `/admin/people` page
- **Progress**: Isolated to specific page, not chart components
- **Impact**: 5% of pages affected during build
- **Analysis**: Likely third-party dependency issue in people management components

### **Root Cause Analysis**
- **Eliminated**: Chart components (recharts/framer-motion) - now SSR-safe
- **Eliminated**: Layout components - all browser APIs guarded
- **Remaining**: Vendor dependency in people management functionality
- **Next Steps**: Investigate people page specific dependencies
