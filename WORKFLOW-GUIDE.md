# 🔄 Professional Git Workflow Guide - RK Institute Management System

## 📋 **Overview**

This guide documents the professional Git workflow implemented for the RK Institute Management System. Our workflow ensures code quality, prevents conflicts, and maintains deployment stability through automated processes.

---

## 🌳 **Branching Strategy (GitFlow)**

### **Branch Structure**

```
main (production)
├── develop (integration)
│   ├── feature/user-authentication
│   ├── feature/fee-calculation-engine
│   ├── bugfix/login-validation-error
│   └── hotfix/security-vulnerability-fix
```

### **Branch Purposes**

| Branch | Purpose | Protection Level | Deployment |
|--------|---------|------------------|------------|
| `main` | Production-ready code | 🔴 Strict | Production (Vercel) |
| `develop` | Integration branch | 🟡 Moderate | Staging |
| `feature/*` | New features | 🟢 Basic | None |
| `bugfix/*` | Bug fixes | 🟢 Basic | None |
| `hotfix/*` | Critical fixes | 🟡 Moderate | Direct to main |

---

## 🚀 **Development Workflow**

### **1. Starting New Work**

```bash
# Update your local repository
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Start development
npm run dev
```

### **2. During Development**

```bash
# Regular commits with conventional format
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT token refresh mechanism"

# Push to remote regularly
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### **3. Before Creating PR**

```bash
# Ensure branch is up to date
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git rebase develop

# Run quality checks
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm test
npm run build

# Push final changes
git push origin feature/your-feature-name --force-with-lease
```

### **4. Creating Pull Request**

1. Navigate to GitHub repository
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Select `develop` as base branch
4. Fill out PR template completely
5. Request reviews from team members
6. Wait for CI checks to pass

### **5. After PR Approval**

- PR is automatically merged using "Squash and Merge"
- Feature branch is automatically deleted
- Changes are deployed to staging environment

---

## 🔄 **CI/CD Pipeline**

### **Continuous Integration (CI)**

Triggered on: Push to `main`/`develop`, Pull Requests

**Pipeline Steps:**
1. 🔍 **Code Quality & Linting**
   - ESLint checks
   - Prettier formatting verification
   
2. 📝 **TypeScript Compilation**
   - Type checking
   - Prisma client generation
   
3. 🏗️ **Build Verification**
   - Next.js build process
   - Asset optimization
   
4. 🔒 **Security Scanning**
   - npm audit for vulnerabilities
   - Dependency security checks
   
5. 🧪 **Test Execution**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Coverage reporting

### **Continuous Deployment (CD)**

**Staging Deployment** (develop branch):
- Automatic deployment to staging environment
- Health checks and smoke tests
- Preview URL generation

**Production Deployment** (main branch):
- Automatic deployment to production
- Zero-downtime deployment
- Post-deployment health checks

---

## 📏 **Code Quality Standards**

### **Automated Checks**

| Check | Tool | Failure Action |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Linting | ESLint | ❌ Block merge |
| Formatting | Prettier | ❌ Block merge |
| Type Safety | TypeScript | ❌ Block merge |
| Build | Next.js | ❌ Block merge |
| Tests | Jest | ⚠️ Warning |
| Security | npm audit | ⚠️ Warning |

### **Manual Review Requirements**

- **Main Branch**: 2 approving reviews required
- **Develop Branch**: 1 approving review required
- **Code Owner Review**: Required for critical files
- **Conversation Resolution**: All comments must be resolved

---

## 🔒 **Branch Protection Rules**

### **Main Branch Protection**
- ✅ Require pull request reviews (2 approvals)
- ✅ Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
- ✅ Require review from code owners
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ❌ Allow force pushes
- ❌ Allow deletions

### **Develop Branch Protection**
- ✅ Require pull request reviews (1 approval)
- ✅ Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
- ✅ Require review from code owners
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ❌ Allow force pushes
- ❌ Allow deletions

---

## 🏷️ **Release Management**

### **Semantic Versioning**

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### **Automated Releases**

Releases are automatically created when:
1. Changes are merged to `main` branch
2. Commit messages follow conventional format
3. Version is automatically determined from commit types

**Release Process:**
1. 🔍 Analyze commit messages since last release
2. 📈 Determine version bump (major/minor/patch)
3. 📝 Generate changelog from commit messages
4. 🏷️ Create Git tag with new version
5. 🚀 Create GitHub release with notes
6. 📦 Update package.json version

## 🛠️ **Local Development Commands**

### **Essential Commands**

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start development server
npm run build           # Build for production
npm run start           # Start production server

# Code Quality
npm run lint            # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix        # Fix ESLint issues
npm run format          # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check    # Check formatting
npm run type-check      # TypeScript type checking

# Testing
npm test               # Run tests
npm run test:watch     # Run tests in watch mode

## 🚨 **Emergency Procedures**

### **Hotfix Process**

For critical production issues:

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-fix

# Make minimal changes
# Test thoroughly
# Commit with clear message

# Create PR to main (expedited review)
# After merge, cherry-pick to develop
git checkout develop
git cherry-pick <hotfix-commit-hash>
```

### **Rollback Process**

If deployment issues occur:
1. 🚨 Identify problematic commit
2. 🔄 Revert commit on main branch
3. 🚀 Automatic deployment of rollback
4. 📝 Create issue to track and fix

- Build success rate
- Average PR review time
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Mean time to recovery

### **Quality Metrics**

---

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **Do's ✅**
- Use descriptive branch names
- Write clear commit messages
- Keep PRs focused and small
- Test changes thoroughly
- Update documentation
- Respond to review comments promptly

### **Don'ts ❌**
- Force push to protected branches
- Merge without reviews
- Skip CI checks
- Commit sensitive data
- Create large, unfocused PRs
- Ignore linting errors

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**CI Checks Failing:**
- Check build logs in GitHub Actions
- Run checks locally first
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

**Merge Conflicts:**
- Rebase feature branch on latest develop
- Resolve conflicts manually
- Test after conflict resolution

**Permission Denied:**
- Ensure you have repository access
- Check if branch protection rules apply
- Contact repository administrator
