### Deployment Pipeline

```
GitHub Push → Quality Gates → Build → Staging → Validation → Production → Monitoring
```

## 🚀 Deployment Procedures

### 1. Pre-Deployment Validation (15 minutes)

#### 1.1 Quality Gates Validation

```bash
# Run comprehensive quality checks
npm run vibe:validate

# Expected output: All checks passing
# ✅ TypeScript compilation: 0 errors
# ✅ ESLint validation: <30% issues remaining
# ✅ Test suite: 95%+ pass rate
# ✅ Build process: Success
```

#### 1.2 Staging Environment Validation

```bash
# Deploy to staging
npm run staging:deploy

# Run staging validation
npm run staging:validate

# Expected output: All validations passing
# ✅ Health checks: All endpoints responding
# ✅ Performance: <1.5s page load time
# ✅ Security: All headers present
# ✅ Database: Connection and queries working
```

#### 1.3 Performance Baseline

```bash
# Run performance tests
npm run performance:test

# Expected metrics:
# - Homepage load time: <1.5s
# - API response time: <500ms
# - Database query time: <200ms
# - Memory usage: <512MB
```

### 2. Production Deployment (10 minutes)

#### 2.1 Automated Deployment

```bash
# Trigger production deployment
npm run production:deploy

# Monitor deployment progress
npm run production:monitor

# Deployment steps:
# 1. Build optimization and bundling
# 2. Asset optimization and compression
# 3. Database migration execution
# 4. Application deployment to Vercel
# 5. DNS propagation and SSL verification
# 6. Health check validation
```

#### 2.2 Deployment Verification

```bash
# Verify production deployment
npm run production:validate

# Expected validations:
# ✅ Application accessibility
# ✅ Database connectivity
# ✅ API endpoints responding
# ✅ SSL certificate valid
# ✅ Performance within SLA
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Monitoring (30 minutes)

#### 3.1 Health Check Monitoring

```bash
# Start continuous monitoring
npm run production:monitor

# Monitor for 30 minutes:
# - Health check endpoints
# - Error rates and response times
# - Database performance
# - User activity and engagement
```

#### 3.2 Performance Validation

```bash
# Run production performance tests
npm run production:performance-test

# Validate SLA compliance:
# - 99.9% uptime requirement
# - <1s average response time
# - <0.1% error rate
# - <1.5s page load time
```

## 🔄 Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

- Health check failures (3 consecutive failures)
- Error rate exceeding 1% for 5 minutes
- Response time exceeding 3s for 5 minutes
- Database connection failures
- SSL certificate issues

### Manual Rollback Process

#### 1. Immediate Rollback (5 minutes)

```bash
# Trigger immediate rollback
npm run production:rollback -- --reason="manual-trigger"

# Rollback steps:
# 1. Identify previous stable deployment
# 2. Revert application to previous version
# 3. Rollback database migrations if necessary
# 4. Validate rollback success
# 5. Update monitoring and alerts
```

#### 2. Rollback Validation (10 minutes)

```bash
# Validate rollback success
npm run production:validate

# Confirm system stability:
# ✅ Application responding normally
# ✅ Database queries working
# ✅ Performance within acceptable range
# ✅ No critical errors in logs
```

#### 3. Incident Communication (5 minutes)

```bash
# Send rollback notifications
npm run production:notify-rollback

# Notifications sent to:
# - Development team (Slack/Email)
# - Operations team (PagerDuty)
# - Stakeholders (Email)
# - Status page update
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Deployment Issues

#### Issue 1: Build Failures

**Symptoms:** Deployment fails during build process
**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Check build logs
npm run build -- --verbose

# Common causes:
# - TypeScript compilation errors
# - Missing dependencies
# - Environment variable issues
# - Memory limitations
```

**Resolution:**

1. Fix TypeScript errors: `npm run vibe:eliminate`
2. Install missing dependencies: `npm install`
3. Verify environment variables: `npm run env:check`
4. Increase build memory: Update Vercel configuration

#### Issue 2: Database Connection Failures

**Symptoms:** Application starts but database queries fail
**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Test database connectivity
npm run db:test

# Check connection string
npm run db:check-config

# Verify database status
npm run db:status
```

**Resolution:**

1. Verify database credentials and connection string
2. Check database server status and availability
3. Validate network connectivity and firewall rules
4. Review database migration status

#### Issue 3: Performance Degradation

**Symptoms:** Slow response times, high resource usage
**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Run performance analysis
npm run performance:analyze

# Check resource usage
npm run production:resources

# Analyze slow queries
npm run db:slow-queries
```

**Resolution:**

1. Optimize database queries and indexes
2. Implement caching strategies
3. Optimize bundle size and loading
4. Scale resources if necessary

#### Issue 4: SSL Certificate Issues

**Symptoms:** HTTPS not working, certificate warnings
**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Check SSL certificate status
npm run ssl:check

# Verify domain configuration
npm run domain:verify
```

**Resolution:**

1. Renew SSL certificate if expired
2. Update DNS configuration
3. Verify domain ownership
4. Contact hosting provider if needed
