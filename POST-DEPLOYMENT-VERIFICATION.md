```bash
# Test login to get token
curl -X POST https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/auth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@rkinstitute.com", "password": "admin123"}'
```

#### **Assignments API Test**
```bash
# Test assignments endpoint (replace TOKEN with actual token)
curl -X GET https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/assignments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

#### **Stats API Test**
```bash
# Test assignment statistics
curl -X GET https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/assignments/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```
